# Chord_Pro
I created the Magical Chords project aiming to learn and practice my programming skills. Currently, the website counts with a PostgreSQL database, which is accessible through the search engine I created using Flask and SQLAlchemy.

Main technologies used in the project:

- HTML, Javascript and Twitter bootstrap, through flask templates
- Unit tests using pytest running in docker
- Site is open source, available on github at https://github.com/Ex-tela/Magical_Chords_Project
- ChordPro format parser and html chord generator written in python
- PostgreSQL as database
